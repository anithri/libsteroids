## Assets and game engine for Libsteroids implementations

Libsteroids is inspired by chriz001's [Reacteroids](https://github.com/chriz001/Reacteroids) and is a means to test out popular JavaScript libraries beyond the very limited scope of DOM-based "Todo" applications.  In addition to manipulating DOM elements, Libsteroids requires some means of displaying visual game updates at 60fps and playing sounds in response to game events.
